		<p> Andrea Brehovska is a 19 year old girl who loves to travel.
			Her dream is to one day get to travel the world (every country!). 
			Her love of travel began when she went to Italy with her family when 
			was 13. It has not slowed down since then! She would always try to convince her family to go visit somewhere cool! And this summer, after 
			she had finally turned 18, she got to go to Italy for her first solo trip. Along with that, she went to Scotland, and many more! </p>

			<p style="color:brown;"> Planes represent most of travelling as people travel with planes! <b> Though she prefers trains, planes add a certain level of nostalgia. </b> And as pictured, with the sunset they are beautiful. </p>
