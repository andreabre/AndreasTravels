		<p> I love to ski. It is probably my favorite sport. I think it geniuenly really helped me out during a time I was not doing the best in, so I am very grateful for it. My favorite ski resorts are Park City in Utah, Mammoth Mountain in California, and Snow Basin in Utah. </p>

			<p style= "color:blueviolet;"> Skiing is such an amazing and fun sport! Though difficult to pick up, once you know it, it is a blast. <b> It is best to learn at the start of Winter! </b> Here it is not too cold yet, but the snow is nice and fluffy, and not slushy!</p>
